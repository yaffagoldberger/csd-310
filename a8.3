Assignment: PySports: Table Queries
For this assignment, you will be learning how to query MySQL database tables through the terminal window and a Python program.
MySQL: Select Query 
SELECT <column_name>, <column_name> FROM <table_name>;
Example
SELECT team_id, team_name, mascot FROM team;

Cursor Example
cursor = db.cursor()

cursor.execute(“SELECT team_id, team_name, mascot FROM team”)

teams = cursor.fetchall()

for team in teams:
print(“Team Name: {}”.format(team[1]))
Instructions
Create a new file under the module_8 directory and name it pysports_queries.py.
Write the code to connect to your MySQL pysports database.
Refer to the previous assignment for code structure.
You can basically copy/paste the code we used in the previous assignment, assuming you were able to get it to work.
Write two select queries, one for the team table and one for the player table.
SELECT team_id, team_name, mascot FROM team.
Using a for loop, iterate over the cursor and display the results.
Make sure your output matches the expected output below (this is gradable).
